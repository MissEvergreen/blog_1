I know the title gives the story away. No, this isn’t a quick read. No, this might not even be a pleasant story. But it’s my story, one of them at least. And I want to share this story.

###  The interviews

“Oh boy, this would be a rollercoaster,” I thought to myself as I left their office building after the first interview round. My insides were twirling with an unusual intensity I haven’t experienced before when it comes to jobs. The nauseating feeling wouldn’t dissolve until I was off the premises and on my half an hour long drive back home. I can’t accept this offer, however appealing the perks, when it makes me feel like this. I trust my gut more than job ads. By the time I was home, I had calmed my guts and could get ready for my working day. It was a Thursday morning in the first week of the year.
A (at-the-time-)colleague of mine had told me of this position. Her brother-in-law worked at the company and she thought I’d be a good fit. For some reason I had sent them my CV in Estonian, while the job ad was in English. I was due to meet them for another round the next week and by the evening I had forgotten the intensity of the anxiety that had struck me that morning. So I created an English CV, sent it and forgot about it.
The next week I got an invite for another interview, for the hiring lady liked my resume. Oh crap. What will I do with this? For the sake of the experience, I should go through with the interview. For the sake of my peace of mind, I should tell them I’m not interested straight away. I accepted the meeting with a heavy heart, wondering if I’ll decide not to show up.
Trying to phrase it as vague as possible, I texted their HR rep something about not feeling great the day before the interview. She texted me back immediately with “our Italian colleague is only here for a few days. Can you make it the next day? She won’t be able to return too soon to interview you.” Well, by all means she didn’t need to return because of me, I wanted to say, but I wasn’t a great decliner back then. Struggling with my conscience and gut feelings, I agreed to meet them a few days from then.
The first meeting had been in the global corporation’s Baltic branch here in Estonia. Located in a sleepy suburban town, the office was far enough for me to gather my thoughts during the drive. I’d been employed by way smaller companies in the past so I didn’t exactly have a reference point for what was awaiting me. The interview itself wasn’t long - they tried to explain to me the expectations for the role but it left me with a feeling that they weren’t sure of the exact tasks themselves. My interviewing-committee consisted of the branch’s CEO, local HR manager and a product manager. The CEO introduced the company history, the HR rep introduced company policy and soft skill expectations and the poor product manager was left with most of the job (and product) explanations. After an oversimplifying description from the product manager (“You see this printed product catalogue? We need you to put this data in the system.”) he tried to assure me they’d get me acquainted with their products which I knew nothing about. All in all they seemed satisfied with me, but the meeting left me with a gnawing feeling in my gut.
Entering the second interview I met with my future boss as well as the new local HR rep as the previous one had just moved on to regional HR duties. The three of us around the table, I heard the company introduction again – this time with very extensive slides. My new boss clearly likes talking. Noted. I remembered very little from her information-packed presentation where she prattled about some numbers and dates and KPIs. And that wasn’t from the lack of trying on my side: I did my best to comprehend what this company values and what it doesn’t, reading as much the lines as between them.
After the monologous introduction to the prestigious story of the company, she asked me some questions. One of them was “what has been your biggest accomplishment”. I told the story of getting my bus driver’s licence in just two months in parallel to a full-time job. Another one was along the lines of “how are your people skills”. So I shared how I’ve done some charity work at an earlier age with children, worked in a pet store for five years and am currently teaching driving. Later on she would recall this as “she teaches people how  to drive a bus” and spread such a story all over the company. Lord knows why.
“What demonstrates your ability to withstand pressure and show persistence while doing so?” I repeated the bit about spending five years in a pet store. She would argue that could hardly be taken into account since the job at hand is after all in a large corporation and cannot be compared to a simple shop clerk position. True, but I had a very horrible boss and I would still carry on since I cared about my job and wanted to make a difference. “Ah, okay,” was the reply. I guess at this point she realised my English is better than hers, despite the excessive amount of corporate jargon she tried to braid in her speech. As a bold Italian woman, she complimented me on my language skill and added that judging by my blue hair I could be crazy enough to fit the position.
I felt heavy leaving that office. Drained. Absolutely certain I don’t want to go there. Besides, I had a good thing going at the job I had - the team was nice, work was dull and I could live a vivid social life on the side with my three other jobs. Why would I wanna leave that? Sure, the new company offered me “ample amount of travelling” – whatever that means – as well as remote working options, both perks the job at the time didn’t include. But surely that wouldn’t outweigh the heaviness…

Career-wise I’ve never been not too ambitious. I’ve had a colourful life and not by choice, so I value peace and calm very highly. Being a hyper-emotional extravert and an Estonian at the same time is almost a cognitive dissonance. You’re supposed to be distant and private. You’re not supposed to have more than three friends. You’re supposed to suffer through everything, that’s embedded in our roots over the last eight hundred years of occupations and genocide. You’re not supposed to stand up for yourself and speak your mind. So, as expected, I’ve gotten into more trouble over the years than ideal because of all these contradicting traits I carry like extra personalities. Hence, I’ve always thought my dream job would be managing a small karaoke bar on a tropical beach, living in a small grass hut nearby. No franchising, if the business is good – “next round is on the house” instead. No cheap-assing on the staff if times are tough – reducing my own pay first. No career – just peace and harmony, you get the idea.
So my dilemma wasn’t really a dilemma. I had decided not to take the job and stay where I am, chilling like a strawberry filling for a while, then see if another position would be more fun. That was my opinion.
The HR rep called on Friday and told me they had chosen me for the job. I thanked them for the honour and said I regretfully decline. That took her by surprise. After she had gathered herself for a moment, she said “You know what, please think it over during the weekend. I’ll call you back on Monday.” You sure? I’m most likely still gonna say no. “Please let me call you on Monday,” she repeated her request. I agreed, hung up and went to pick up an acquaintance from the airport with a sinking feeling.
I held up my end of the bargain by really thinking it over, simulating putting together a list of pros and cons in my head. I discussed the matter with friends and enriched the list with their feedback. The most prominent message that shone through the discussions like a neon sign in a dark alleyway, luring people in for a dance and getting their asses robbed bare by some thugs afterwards, was “what have you got to lose”. Or “take the chance”. Same thing, in my opinion. Boy, if I only knew how their suggestions would be smeared with a world class shitshow back then. I would have incorporated a wee little “I told you so”.
Nagh, that would have been petty, and – as much as I’d like to – I can’t hold anyone else responsible for what has happened but myself. I’m responsible for my life. But it’s kinda like the end of IT crowd, the epic last season of an hour-long-episode, where Roy asks Moss and Jen “...the stuff that’s been happening to us, that’s not entirely normal, is it?” Even though I am responsible, I’m still allowed to think it’s bullshit and a bit too much.
So the ominous Monday arrived. The phone rang. I said the stupid ‘yes’. By the evening I had the first documents in my email. It was the latter half of January.

### I’m hired!

The first drive to work seemed never ending and not long enough simultaneously. The first step into the office declared I’m now a gear in corporate machinery. The first person to greet me was the office administrator who had already added me on Facebook a week prior. I greeted the new project manager by the door and we were sent to the IT room where we got handed our laptops. We then met with the induction team in a meeting room. It was almost half past February.
The first weeks consisted of getting to know the local team. The task of setting that up for the new team somehow landed on my desk. I had never done anything like this before. I almost hadn’t sent formal emails! It’s cool, I thought, I got this. So I conjured up some minimalistic emails introducing the new team – my manager and I – that were gonna work on this awesome and useful new platform that enables the company’s multichannel marketing strategy… wait, what? I had no clue what this jargon even means. Trying hard to understand though, praise the lord for my googling skills. Anyway, the ends of the emails were along the lines of “when is it good for you to spend half an hour with us to explain your field of expertise?” – since we still hadn’t any clue of ours, would be nice to see others be fluent about theirs.
